# HiPy Micro Challenges

These "micro" challenges have been designed to showcase a useful/fun aspect of Python. They have been categorised as "easy", "intermediate" and "hard" and are designed to cater for the hive's wide range of ability (from novice to pro).


# Advice

We recommend that during the meet you work on these challenges in pairs (or threes) and that you proceed at your own pace. If you get stuck don't panic - checkout the "solutions" branch for a working solution. Make sure you understand each line of code fully before moving on.

# Feedback

Don't forget to let us know what you think of the challenges. Can we make them better? Can you suggest additional challenges that would be useful in the context of your own field or study/research? Talk to us.
